presentation given at the Northeast Ohio Regional GIS Symposium

outline/slides: 


(explain why open source + data is cool in a few ways)
 - customizable 
 - no vendor lockin 
 - someelse likely has written a better list than me in a more convincing fashion 
 - facilitate inter-agency sharing; no longer phone calling/emailing for the current version of data. 


So, what cool projects are going on? 


openaddresses ! 

 - all addresses; EVERYWHERE! 

 - show that mapbox blog map of how ohio has the best coverage in the state, thanks to 
myself and LBRS (and ask for license from any attendees)
