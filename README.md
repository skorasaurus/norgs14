How GIS is becoming Open 

 - open or die?! (slide har, har)
 - 

presentation given at the Northeast Ohio Regional GIS Symposium

outline/slides: 


(explain why open source + data is cool in a few ways)
 - no vendor lockin 
 - someelse likely has written a better list than me in a more convincing fashion 
 - facilitate inter-agency sharing; no longer phone calling/emailing for the current version of data. 

(I'm going with the presumption that I'm not going to convince them to use qgis overnight, but show them what's possible using open data and open programs...)


GEOJSON 


- used to  store geometries of web maps; 
- JSON (javascript object notation) 
- machine readable, makes it really powerful for scripting and automation! 
- designed for web maps 

 (topojson)


D3 at all? 


So, what cool projects are going on? 

openaddresses ! 

 - all addresses, in one place. 

 - all addresses; EVERYWHERE! 

 - show that mapbox blog map of how ohio has the best coverage in the state, thanks to 
myself and LBRS (and ask for license from any attendees)


OpenTrails 

- Used by 10 Agencies right now including 

Cleveland Metroparks and Summit Metroparks! 

TOOLS:


geojson.io ! 

- make gif of satellite view in it 

- gif of drawing points 

- then gif of saving to CSV/SHP/whatever


Openstreetmap 

- NYC 


Mapbox

qgis 
 - sorta like arc (so I've heard)
